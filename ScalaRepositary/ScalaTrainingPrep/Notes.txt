scala inheritance is implemented in two ways 
-> subclassing : keyword extends
-> mixin-based composition : keyword with

mutliple ineritance can be done via mixin-based composition


Scala is functional :
1) Every function is a value (And every value is an object)
2) Scala supports higher-order functions.(functions that can take another function as parameter or return function as parameter).
3) Scala allows nested functions.(A function can be defined in another function)
4) Scala allows anonymous function and it has light-weight syntax for it
5) scala supports currying
6) To group functions which are not related to any other class, use singleton objects.
